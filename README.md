# Library Database Management System (DBMS)

## Project Overview

The **Library Database Management System (DBMS)** is designed to efficiently manage and organize library resources, facilitating both library staff and patrons in accessing, cataloging, and tracking materials. The system automates tasks such as book checkouts, returns, and catalog updates, ensuring smooth operations and an enhanced user experience.

### Key Features:
- **Book Cataloging:** Centralized database for organizing books, journals, and other resources.
- **Search Functionality:** Quick and effective search by title, author, genre, and more.
- **Loan Management:** Tracks borrowed items, due dates, and overdue notifications.
- **User Management:** Stores patron details, borrowing history, and membership status.
- **Real-time Updates:** Up-to-date information on book availability and loan status.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js (with Express.js for routing and handling requests)
- **Database:** Relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Tools and Libraries:** 
  - HTML5, CSS3 for structure and styling
  - JavaScript (Node.js) for handling backend logic
  - Express.js for routing
  - Sequelize or other ORM (if used) for database interaction

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed on your system.
- A working database setup (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shane376/group2-Fall2024.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   - For front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), there are no external dependencies.
   - If you're using any backend or server, you might need to install specific dependencies.

   Example for installing a simple web server:
   ```bash
   npm install --save <dependency-name>  # for Node.js/JavaScript projects
   ```

4. Open the project in your browser or start the server:
   - Open the terminal and use "node app.js"

5. Enjoy the app!
